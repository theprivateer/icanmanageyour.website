Most website problems don't announce themselves.

There's no error message. No alert. No email telling you something went wrong.

Instead, potential customers quietly leave.

Hard-to-use websites don't usually fail in obvious ways. They create small points of friction that interrupt confidence and momentum. Each one nudges people closer to giving up.

## Slow load times test patience immediately

People expect websites to load quickly. Not instantly, but quickly enough that they don't have to think about it.

When a site is slow:

- visitors hesitate
- attention drifts
- confidence drops    

Some people wait. Many don't.

Every extra second creates doubt, especially for first-time visitors who don't yet trust your business. Lost patience often means lost enquiries before the page even finishes loading.

## Confusing navigation creates decision fatigue

When someone lands on your website, they're usually trying to answer a simple question:

"Is this right for me?"

If navigation is unclear, cluttered, or inconsistent, that question becomes harder to answer.

Visitors start guessing where information might be. They click back and forth. They second-guess themselves.

That mental effort is friction. And friction makes people leave.

A confusing menu doesn't just frustrate users. It costs you the chance to guide them toward contacting you.

## Poor mobile layouts lose people fast

For many businesses, most visitors arrive on mobile.

When a site isn't designed properly for smaller screens, common problems appear:

- text that's hard to read
- buttons that are difficult to tap
- layouts that require zooming or sideways scrolling    

These aren't dramatic failures. They're subtle signals that the site wasn't built with the user in mind.

On mobile, tolerance is low. If it feels awkward, people move on quickly, often without trying again on desktop.

## Forms are where friction becomes loss

Forms are one of the most critical parts of a website.

When forms are hard to use, people don't complain. They abandon them.

Common friction points include:

- unclear labels
- too many required fields
- confusing error messages
- forms that don't work well on mobile

Each abandoned form is a lost enquiry you'll never see in your inbox.

## Friction doesn't show up in obvious ways

The hardest part about usability problems is that they're invisible from the business side.

You don't see:

- the visitor who gave up
- the sale that didn't happen
- the enquiry that was almost sent  

All you see is quieter-than-expected results.

That's why hard-to-use websites are so costly. They underperform without creating a clear problem to fix.

## Usability improvements pay off quietly

Making a website easier to use doesn't usually involve dramatic changes.

It's about:

- speeding things up
- simplifying navigation
- improving mobile layouts    
- reducing effort at key moments

These changes remove friction. When friction is gone, confidence increases and action feels easier.

## If your website feels fine but results feel light

If your website looks okay but enquiries or sales aren't where you expect them to be, usability is worth examining.

I help businesses identify and reduce friction on their websites through practical, ongoing improvements that make it easier for customers to take the next step.
