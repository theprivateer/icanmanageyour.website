title: "Why websites break even when you don't touch them"

One of the most common things I hear from clients is:

> "But we haven't changed anything."

And that's usually true.

The surprise is that websites don't exist in a sealed box. Even if you never log in, never update a word, and never touch a setting, the world around your website keeps moving.

Over time, that movement is exactly what causes things to break.

## A website is more like a car than a brochure

A printed brochure can sit in a drawer for ten years and still look the same.

A website is closer to a car parked on the street.

Even if you don't drive it:

- the battery slowly drains
- tyres lose pressure
- parts age
- regulations change

Eventually, you turn the key and something doesn't start.

Websites work the same way.

## Plugins are like spare parts from different manufacturers

Most modern websites rely on plugins or add-ons. These handle things like contact forms, online payments, galleries, bookings, and SEO.

Each plugin is built by a different team. They update their software regularly to:

- fix bugs
- add features
- patch security holes

If your site isn't keeping up, those plugins slowly fall out of sync with each other and with the rest of your site. It's like mixing new car parts with old ones that were never designed to fit together.

At first everything seems fine.

Then a form stops sending.

Or checkout fails.

Or the site suddenly crashes after "one small update".

## Hosting changes happen whether you like it or not

Your hosting provider also updates things behind the scenes.

They upgrade server software, change configurations, and retire older systems. Most of this is done for good reasons: performance, stability, and security.

But if your website is built on older assumptions, those changes can expose cracks. Something that worked perfectly for years can stop overnight, even though you didn't touch a thing.

It's like a building where the power company upgrades the grid. The lights are better for everyone, but an old appliance suddenly trips the circuit.

## Browsers evolve, and your site has to keep up

Web browsers don't stand still either. Chrome, Safari, Edge, and Firefox are updated constantly.

They change how they handle:

- privacy
- security
- scripts
- older code patterns

If your site hasn't been maintained, a browser update can make it look broken, behave oddly, or stop working altogether for visitors. You might not notice it immediately, but your customers will.
## Security patches aren't optional anymore

Security is one of the biggest reasons websites "mysteriously" fail.

When vulnerabilities are discovered, updates are released quickly. If they aren't applied, automated bots eventually find the gap. That can lead to:

- hacked sites
- spam pages
- malware warnings
- hosting suspensions

At that point the site isn't just broken, it's actively damaging your business.

## The slow drift is what catches people out

The tricky part is that none of this usually fails all at once.

Things drift.

Small warnings appear.

Minor issues are ignored.

Then one day something critical stops working.

From the outside it looks sudden.

In reality, it's been building quietly for months or years.

## This is why "set and forget" doesn't work for websites

A website isn't something you finish and walk away from. It needs light, regular care to stay healthy.

That doesn't mean constant redesigns or endless tinkering. It means having someone responsible for:

- updates
- compatibility
- security
- catching problems early

## If you want peace of mind, let's talk

If you're not sure whether your website is quietly drifting toward trouble, I can help.

I work with business owners who want their website to:

- keep working
- stay secure
- avoid nasty surprises
