It's easy to design a website for an ideal user.

They have a large screen, a fast connection, plenty of time, and full attention. They understand how websites work and know exactly what they're looking for.

Real people are nothing like that.

Real people are distracted, tired, busy, and using whatever device happens to be in their hand at the time. Designing for them requires empathy, not assumptions.

## People don't use websites in perfect conditions

Most people aren't sitting at a desk with time set aside to explore your site.

They're:

- on a phone between meetings    
- on a train with patchy reception
- in bright sunlight
- holding a baby
- switching between tasks
- dealing with fatigue, pain, or stress

A website that only works well in ideal conditions quietly excludes a lot of potential customers.

## Abilities vary, even for the same person

Accessibility isn't just about permanent conditions.

Someone might have:

- reduced vision after a long day    
- a temporary injury that limits movement
- difficulty concentrating
- a noisy environment that makes audio unusable

Designing for real people means assuming variation, not uniformity.

Clear text, simple layouts, and forgiving interactions help everyone, not just a specific group.

## Devices shape behaviour

People use websites on all kinds of devices:

- large monitors    
- small phones
- older tablets
- touchscreens
- keyboards

Each one changes how content is read and actions are taken.

When a site is designed with flexibility in mind, it adapts to these differences. When it isn't, small frustrations stack up and people leave.

## Confusion is often a design problem, not a user problem

When someone struggles to use a website, it's tempting to assume they're not "tech-savvy".

In reality, confusion is often a signal that the site is asking too much of the user.

Clear navigation, plain language, and obvious next steps reduce cognitive load. They make people feel capable instead of uncertain.

That feeling matters. People act when they feel confident.

## Empathy leads to better outcomes

Designing with empathy doesn't mean lowering standards.

It means recognising that your customers are human.

When a website:

- loads quickly    
- explains things clearly
- works well on any device
- forgives small mistakes

people stay longer, trust more, and take action more readily.

## This isn't about perfection

Designing for real people doesn't require getting everything right.

It requires caring about how the site feels to use, not just how it looks.

Small, thoughtful choices add up:

- clearer wording    
- better spacing
- more obvious buttons
- fewer assumptions

These details signal respect for the user's time and situation.

## If you want your website to work in the real world

If your website was designed for ideal conditions, it may be quietly excluding real customers.

I help businesses improve usability and accessibility by focusing on how real people actually use their sites, across different devices, abilities, and contexts.
