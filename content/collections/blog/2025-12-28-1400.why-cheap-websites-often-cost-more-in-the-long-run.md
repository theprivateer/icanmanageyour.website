When you're running a small business, it makes sense to keep costs down. A website can feel like an easy place to save money. After all, it's "just a website".

Sometimes that choice works out. Often, it doesn't.

The real cost of a website isn't always obvious at the start. It shows up gradually, over time.

## A realistic timeline

### Month 0: Launch

A low-cost website goes live. It looks fine and ticks the basic boxes. The price felt reasonable and the process was quick.

At this point, there's no problem to see.

### Month 6: Small changes start to add up

The business needs a few updates:
- A new service
- A pricing change
- A form tweak

Each change costs more than expected or takes longer than promised. Sometimes the answer is, "That's not included."

Nothing is broken, but the site is starting to feel rigid.

### Month 12: Performance and reliability issues

The site begins to feel slow. A plugin update breaks a layout. The contact form stops sending emails for a few days before anyone notices.

A handful of enquiries are lost. No one can say exactly how many.

The site is still online, but it's no longer dependable.

### Month 18: Growth hits a wall

The business wants to:
- Improve SEO
- Add online bookings
- Redesign for mobile

It turns out the site can't easily support these changes. The platform is outdated or heavily customised. Fixing it would mean undoing a lot of previous work.

At this point, the word "rebuild" enters the conversation.

### Month 24: The rebuild

The site is rebuilt properly. Content is migrated. Hosting is upgraded. Performance issues are addressed.

The new site works better, but the total cost over two years is far higher than expected. Not just in money, but in time, frustration, and missed opportunities.

## The hidden costs explained

### Rebuilds
Rebuilding a site isn't just paying twice. It often means redoing content, retraining staff, and losing momentum.

### Downtime
When a site is slow, broken, or unreliable, leads are lost quietly. There's no alert to tell you how many.

### Lost leads
Even small usability issues can reduce enquiries. A confusing form or slow page doesn't stop everyone, just enough to matter.

### Opportunity cost
Time spent dealing with website problems is time not spent running the business.

## What "value" actually looks like

A more expensive website isn't automatically better. Value comes from fit and longevity.

A high-value website usually:
- Uses well-supported, standard technology
- Can grow with the business
- Is easy to maintain and update
- Has clear ownership and access
- Is supported by someone who explains things clearly

It doesn't need to be perfect on day one. It needs to be solid and adaptable.

## How to evaluate value properly

Instead of focusing only on the upfront price, ask:
- How easy will this be to change in a year?
- What's included in ongoing support?
- Who owns the domain, hosting, and content?
- Can another developer work on this if needed?
- What happens if the business grows or changes direction?

The answers to these questions matter more than the initial quote.

## A steady investment beats a quick win

Websites are long-term assets. When they're built with care, they quietly support a business for years.

When they're built cheaply, they often work just well enough to delay the real cost.

Paying for quality isn't about spending more. It's about spending once, wisely.
