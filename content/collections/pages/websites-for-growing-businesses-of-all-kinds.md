      No two businesses are the same, and the same is true of their websites.

      I work with a wide range of small businesses and organisations, helping them build websites that fit what they actually need right now, while leaving room to grow later. The goal is always the same: a website that supports your business, rather than getting in the way of it.

      Over the years, I've worked with many different kinds of organisations, including:

      ### Local service providers and trades

      Businesses that rely on trust, clarity, and being easy to contact. These sites focus on clear services, strong local presence, and making it simple for customers to get in touch or request a quote.

      ### Professional services

      Consultants, accountants, agencies, and specialists who need to explain what they do clearly and build confidence quickly. These websites often balance credibility, clear messaging, and thoughtful content that supports conversations rather than hard sells.

      ### Retail businesses and e-commerce stores

      From simple product catalogues to fully online stores. The focus here is on usability, performance, and making it easy for customers to browse, buy, and come back again.

      ### Creatives, studios, and independent professionals

      Designers, writers, photographers, and solo operators who need their website to reflect their work without overcomplicating things. These sites are often clean, content-led, and designed to showcase work while still supporting enquiries.

      ### Community organisations and small teams

      Groups that need clear communication, easy updates, and websites that can be maintained over time without relying on one technical person. Simplicity, accessibility, and sustainability matter most here.

      Some businesses need a straightforward informational site that clearly explains who they are and how to get in touch.

      Others need a content-driven website that supports marketing, thought leadership, or ongoing publishing.

      Some need an online store that's reliable, easy to manage, and built to scale gradually.

      I don't start with a template or a fixed package. I start by understanding:

      - what your business does    
      - who the website is for
      - what you need it to achieve
      - what level of complexity actually makes sense

      From there, the website is shaped around those needs.

      I don't believe in forcing businesses into bloated platforms or over-engineered solutions "just in case".

      That often leads to:

      - unnecessary cost
      - harder maintenance
      - features you never use
      - confusion about how the site actually works

      Instead, I focus on building websites that are:

      - appropriate for the business stage you're in
      - clear and usable for real people 
      - easy to evolve as your needs change

      You get what you need, not what looks impressive on a feature list.

      Even simple websites should be built sensibly.

      That means:

      - clean structure
      - solid foundations
      - room to expand later
      - no shortcuts that create problems down the line

      Whether your business stays small or grows significantly, your website shouldn't need to be rebuilt just because it was rushed or overcomplicated at the start.

      If you're a growing business looking for a website that reflects where you are now and supports where you're heading, I can help.

      I work in plain English, focus on practical outcomes, and build websites that are meant to be used, not admired and forgotten.

      If you'd like to talk through what kind of website actually makes sense for your business, get in touch. I'm happy to discuss your goals, your budget, and the best way forward without pressure or jargon.
