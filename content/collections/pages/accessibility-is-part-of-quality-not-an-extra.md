      Accessibility isn't something you add at the end of a project.

      It's part of building a website properly in the first place.

      When a site is accessible, it's easier to use, clearer to understand, and more resilient across different devices, abilities, and situations. That benefits everyone, not just a small subset of users.

    title: 'Built in from the start'
    content: |-
      I treat accessibility as a core part of the build, not a checklist item.

      That means considering things like:

      - keyboard navigation that works predictably
      - screen reader support that makes sense
      - readable text with sensible contrast
      - clear headings and structure
      - interaction patterns that don't rely on guesswork

      These choices are made early, not retrofitted later.

    title: 'Designed for real-world use'
    content: |-
      People don't use websites in perfect conditions.

      They might be:

      - on a phone with one hand    
      - using a keyboard instead of a mouse
      - dealing with vision, motor, or cognitive challenges
      - tired, distracted, or under time pressure

      Accessible design assumes variety, not ideal users. It focuses on making the site forgiving and understandable in everyday situations.

    title: 'Accessibility improves usability for everyone'

      Most accessibility improvements also improve usability.

      Clear structure makes pages easier to scan.

      Readable content reduces mental effort.

      Consistent navigation builds confidence.

      When people don't have to fight the interface, they're more likely to stay, understand your message, and take the next step.

    title: 'Easier to maintain over time'
    content: |-
      Accessible websites tend to age better.

      Clear structure and sensible patterns make:

      - content updates simpler    
      - changes less risky
      - future improvements easier to implement

      This reduces long-term maintenance friction and helps avoid costly rebuilds caused by brittle design decisions.

    title: 'Reducing risk as expectations evolve'
    content: |-
      Accessibility expectations continue to rise.

      Browsers improve. Devices change. Standards evolve. Public awareness grows.

      Building accessibility in from the start reduces risk over time. It avoids scrambling to retrofit fixes later and helps ensure your website remains usable and defensible as expectations change.

    title: 'Accessibility as a marker of quality'
    content: |-
      An accessible website signals care and professionalism.

      It shows that:

      - you value your audience    
      - you respect different needs
      - you've invested in doing things properly

      That message matters, even if visitors can't articulate it consciously.

    title: 'If you want a website built with care'
    content: |-
      If you're looking for a website that's built to work well for more people, in more situations, for longer, accessibility needs to be part of the foundation.

      I build websites with accessibility woven into the design and development process, not treated as an optional extra.

      If you'd like to talk about how accessibility fits into your website project, get in touch. I'm happy to explain the approach and answer any questions in plain English.
