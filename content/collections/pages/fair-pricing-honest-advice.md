      Website projects work best when expectations are clear from the start.

      That includes pricing, timelines, and what you're actually getting for your investment. I aim to be upfront and realistic about all of it, so there are no surprises later.

    title: 'Priced for long-term value'
    content: |-
      My services are competitively and fairly priced, with a focus on long-term value rather than shortcuts.

      That means:

      - building things properly the first time
      - avoiding fragile or overly clever solutions
      - choosing approaches that won't cost more to fix later    

      You're not paying for unnecessary complexity or inflated features. You're paying for a website that's meant to work reliably over time.

    title: 'Clear advice, not sales pressure'
    content: |-
      I don't believe in selling people things they don't need.

      If a simpler solution makes more sense for your situation, that's what I'll recommend. If a bigger build isn't justified yet, I'll say so.

      Good advice sometimes means talking you out of spending money, not pushing you to spend more.

    title: 'Realistic timelines you can trust'
    content: |-
      Website timelines are often overpromised and underdelivered.

      I prefer to set timelines that account for:

      - real business constraints 
      - decision points and feedback cycles
      - content preparation
      - testing and refinement 

      If something is going to take time, you'll know why. If something can move faster, I'll tell you that too.

    title: 'Built to last, not just to launch'
    content: |-
      A website shouldn't be treated as a one-day event.

      I build websites with an eye on:

      - ongoing updates
      - future changes
      - maintenance and support
      - how the site will be used six months or two years from now

      The goal is usefulness and sustainability, not a flashy launch followed by long-term frustration.

      Not every project is a good fit, and that's okay.

      If I don't think I'm the right person for your situation, or if a different approach would serve you better, I'll tell you. That honesty saves everyone time and leads to better outcomes in the long run.

    title: 'No hidden trade-offs'
    content: |-
      I aim to be clear about:

      - what's included
      - what's optional
      - what might come later
      - where ongoing costs exist

      You shouldn't have to decode fine print to understand what you're committing to.

      If you're looking for a website built on clear advice, fair pricing, and realistic expectations, I can help.

      I work with businesses who value straightforward communication and long-term usefulness over quick wins.

      If you'd like to talk through your needs and get an honest opinion on what makes sense, get in touch. I'm happy to discuss options and help you decide whether working together is the right fit.
