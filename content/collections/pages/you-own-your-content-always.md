      Your website should belong to you.

      That sounds obvious, but in practice it's not always how things are set up. Many businesses only discover later that their site is tied to a platform, provider, or editor they can't easily leave.  

      I take a different approach. When I build a website, you fully own it.

      True ownership means you control:

      - your content
      - your data
      - your hosting
      - who works on your site

      You're not dependent on a single vendor or locked into a system that limits your options.

      If you want to change direction, add features, or move providers in the future, you can do that without starting over.

    title: 'No forced subscriptions or lock-in'
    content: |-
      Some website platforms look inexpensive or convenient at first, but come with ongoing subscriptions or restrictions that are hard to escape later.

      That can mean:

      - rising monthly costs    
      - limited flexibility
      - difficulty exporting content
      - rebuilds that feel unnecessary

      I avoid setups that trap you in long-term commitments you didn't explicitly choose.

    title: 'Built on tools you can leave'
    content: |-
      I build websites using widely supported, standard technologies.

      That means:

      - your content isn't locked inside a proprietary editor    
      - another developer can work on the site if needed
      - your website can move with you as your business evolves

      You're never stuck because of a technical decision made years earlier.

    title: 'Freedom to grow and change'
    content: |-
      Businesses change. Your website should be able to change with it.

      Ownership gives you freedom to:

      - add new services or sections    
      - expand content
      - integrate new tools
      - adjust how the site works over time

      You're not boxed into a structure that only made sense on day one.

    title: 'Fewer surprises later'
    content: |-
      Clear ownership avoids awkward moments down the track.

      No surprise renewal fees.

      No last-minute rebuilds just to move platforms.

      No scrambling to recover content from a system you don't control.

      Everything is transparent from the start.

    title: 'Ownership is part of quality'
    content: |-
      A well-built website isn't just about how it looks or performs today.

      It's about:

      - sustainability
      - flexibility
      - long-term value

      Ownership is part of that quality. It ensures the site remains an asset, not a liability, as your business grows.

    title: "If you want a website that's truly yours"
    content: |-
      If you're investing in a website, you should come away with something you fully own and understand.

      I build websites that give clients control and flexibility, without lock-in or hidden constraints.

      If you'd like to talk about building a site that you truly own, get in touch. I'm happy to explain the options and make sure everything is clear before any work begins.
