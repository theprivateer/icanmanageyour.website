    content: |-
      Running a business is hard enough without worrying about your website. I provide ongoing website management for small to medium sized businesses that want their site kept online, secure, and up to date without having to deal with the technical details.

      With over 20 years of professional experience, I am a trusted and reliable web designer and developer who looks after websites so business owners can focus on their work.

    title: 'Support for non-technical and time-poor businesses'
    content: |-
      Many of my clients do not want to learn how hosting, updates, or security patches work. They just want their website to be there when customers need it.

      I work with:

      - Small business owners with limited time
      - Teams without in-house technical staff
      - Businesses that rely on their website but do not want to manage it
      - Organisations that need a dependable point of contact

      You deal with a real person who knows your website, not a generic support desk.

    title: 'WordPress problems fixed properly'
    content: |-
      WordPress is powerful, but it can quickly become unstable when themes, plugins, and updates are poorly managed. I regularly repair WordPress websites that have broken after updates, suffered performance issues, or become bloated and unreliable over time.

      That may involve fixing plugin conflicts, cleaning up themes, improving performance, or recommending a safer long-term approach if WordPress is no longer the right fit.

    content: |-
      I provide managed hosting that is fast, secure, and monitored. That includes keeping your site running, handling server updates, and responding quickly if something goes wrong.

      You do not need to worry about renewals, technical alerts, or sudden outages. Your website is actively looked after.

    title: 'Security fixes and regular maintenance'
    content: |-
      Websites need ongoing care to stay secure. I handle security updates, apply patches, and monitor for issues that could put your site at risk.

      For WordPress and other CMS-based websites, this includes maintaining plugins, themes, and core updates in a controlled way that reduces the chance of things breaking.

    content: |-
      If you need changes made to your website, I can handle them for you. That might be updating text and images, adding new pages, posting news or blog content, or making small layout improvements.

      You can send updates by email or message and know they will be taken care of properly, without you having to log in or learn a system.

    content: |-
      My services are competitively and fairly priced, with clear expectations and no surprises. The goal is not to upsell or overcomplicate things, but to provide steady, dependable support.

      If something needs attention, I will tell you. If nothing does, your site simply keeps working in the background.
