      A good website doesn't need to be flashy to be effective.

      It needs to be clear, easy to use, and dependable. Visitors should be able to find what they're looking for quickly, without friction or confusion. Search engines should be able to understand the site just as easily.

      That balance is what I focus on in every build.

    title: 'Clean design that puts clarity first'
    content: |-
      Clean design isn't about minimalism for its own sake. It's about removing distractions so the important things stand out.

      That means:

      - clear layouts that guide people through the page
      - readable text that works across devices
      - sensible use of colour and spacing
      - interfaces that feel familiar rather than clever

      The goal is to help visitors understand what you do and what to do next, without making them think too hard.

    title: 'Built to work everywhere'
    content: |-
      People visit websites on all kinds of devices and connections.

      Your site should work just as well:

      - on a phone as it does on a desktop
      - on a slower mobile connection as it does on fast Wi-Fi
      - for people skimming quickly as well as those reading closely
        
      I build websites with responsiveness and resilience in mind, so they feel solid no matter how or where they're accessed.

      Search engine optimisation works best when it's built in from the beginning.

      Rather than bolting SEO on later, I focus on:

      - clear page structure    
      - meaningful headings
      - sensible URLs
      - content that actually explains what you do
      - internal linking that makes sense
        
      This helps search engines understand your site and improves visibility without relying on tricks or short-term tactics.

    title: 'Technical foundations that support visibility'
    content: |-
      Good SEO isn't just about words on a page. It's also about how the site is put together.

      Clean, well-structured code makes it easier for search engines to:

      - crawl your site
      - index your pages
      - understand how content is related

      This technical clarity supports long-term visibility and reduces the risk of problems later.

    content: |-
      Performance isn't just a technical detail. It has real business impact.

      Slow websites:

      - lose impatient visitors    
      - see higher bounce rates
      - convert fewer enquiries or sales

      Faster websites keep people engaged and tend to perform better in search results. They also feel more trustworthy, especially to first-time visitors.

    title: 'Performance-informed decisions'
    content: |-
      Every decision in a build affects performance in some way.

      That includes:

      - layout choices    
      - image handling
      - scripts and plugins
      - how content is structured

      I aim to make sensible trade-offs, keeping the site fast and responsive without cutting corners that create issues later.

      Design, SEO, and performance aren't separate concerns. They reinforce each other.

      When a website is:

      - clear to use    
      - easy to understand
      - quick to load

      it supports your business goals naturally.

      If you're looking for a website that balances design, visibility, and performance without unnecessary complexity, I can help.

      I build websites that are clean, understandable, and built to last, with SEO and performance considered from day one.  

      If you'd like to talk about what that could look like for your business, get in touch. I'm happy to explain my approach and see if it's the right fit.
