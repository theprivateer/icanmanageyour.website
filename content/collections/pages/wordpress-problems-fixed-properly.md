      WordPress is a solid platform when it's set up and maintained well.

      But it's also very easy for it to drift. A few extra plugins here. A theme change there. Updates applied without testing. Hosting that was "good enough" at the start but never reviewed again.

      Over time, small compromises add up.

      What started as a simple, reliable website can become slow, fragile, and unpredictable.

      That's usually when I get the call.

      Most WordPress issues don't appear overnight. They creep in.

      You might notice:

      - The site is slower than it used to be
      - Updates cause errors or layout issues
      - Features stop working without warning
      - You're seeing strange warnings in the dashboard
      - Forms stop sending emails
      - The site occasionally goes offline
      - It feels cluttered and hard to manage

      Often, there isn't just one problem. There's a stack of them.

      My job is to step back, assess the whole system, and fix it properly rather than applying another quick patch.

    title: 'Fixing plugin conflicts and update issues'
    content: |-
      Plugins are one of WordPress's strengths. They're also one of its biggest risks.

      When plugins aren't maintained, or when too many overlapping tools are installed, conflicts are inevitable. An update to one plugin can break another. A theme update can clash with custom code. PHP version changes on the server can expose weaknesses that have been sitting quietly for years.

      Instead of guessing, I:

      - Review all installed plugins and remove unnecessary ones
      - Check compatibility between themes, plugins, and WordPress core
      - Test updates safely before applying them to your live site
      - Replace outdated or abandoned plugins with better alternatives
      - Fix underlying structural issues, not just visible symptoms

      The goal isn't just to "get it working again". It's to make it stable.

    title: 'Cleaning up bloated themes and messy builds'

      Many WordPress sites suffer from theme overload.

      Page builders layered on top of heavy themes. Multiple styling systems fighting each other. Custom tweaks added in ways that make future updates risky.

      This creates:

      - Sluggish performance
      - Inconsistent layouts
      - Difficulty making simple content changes
      - Fragile update paths

      In some cases, the right fix is careful cleanup. In others, it's rebuilding parts of the site in a cleaner, simpler way.

      I'll always explain the options clearly, including what's worth repairing and what's not.

      Speed problems are often blamed on hosting alone. In reality, performance issues are usually a mix of:

      - Oversized images
      - Poorly optimised themes
      - Too many plugins
      - Inefficient database usage
      - Unnecessary scripts loading on every page

      I focus on practical improvements that make a measurable difference. No hype. No complicated dashboards you have to manage yourself.

      Just a site that feels responsive again.

      Unmaintained WordPress sites are a common target for automated attacks.

      Part of fixing a struggling site often involves:

      - Updating WordPress core safely
      - Ensuring all plugins and themes are actively maintained
      - Removing abandoned or risky components
      - Tightening up file permissions and configuration
      - Confirming backups are in place and usable

      Security isn't about installing one more plugin. It's about reducing complexity and keeping the stack healthy.

      Sometimes the honest answer is that WordPress isn't the best long-term solution for your needs.

      If your site has been stretched far beyond its original purpose, or if it relies on layers of workarounds, it may be safer and more cost-effective to consider a different approach.

      I'll tell you that directly.

      That doesn't mean a full rebuild is always required. But it does mean looking at the bigger picture rather than endlessly patching.

      When something breaks, it's stressful. Especially if your business relies on your website.

      I approach WordPress problems methodically:

      1. Assess the full setup
      2. Identify root causes
      3. Stabilise the site
      4. Clean up unnecessary complexity
      5. Put a sensible maintenance plan in place

      You'll deal with one person who understands both the technical detail and the business impact.
