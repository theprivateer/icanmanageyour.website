      Website support shouldn't feel unpredictable.

      You shouldn't be wondering what the next invoice will look like, whether something has quietly been added to your scope, or if you're paying for work that doesn't really need to be done.

      My approach is simple: clear expectations, fair pricing, steady support.

      Before any ongoing work begins, we agree on what's included.

      That might cover:

      - Managed hosting
      - Regular maintenance and updates
      - Security monitoring
      - Content changes
      - Priority support    

      You'll know what you're paying for and what falls outside that scope. If something extra is required, we'll discuss it first. No surprises.

      The goal is transparency, not complexity.

      Good website management does not need to be inflated or wrapped in technical language to justify the cost.

      You're paying for:

      - Experience
      - Ongoing oversight
      - Proactive maintenance
      - Rapid response when something goes wrong
      - Peace of mind    

      I price services in a way that reflects the real work involved, without padding it out with unnecessary add-ons or bundled features you don't need.

      Some providers are always looking for the next upgrade, redesign, or package tier.

      That's not how I work.

      If your website is functioning well and meeting your needs, there's no reason to suggest change for the sake of it.

      If something genuinely needs attention, I'll explain why and outline your options clearly. If nothing needs doing, I'll say that too.

      The aim is long-term stability, not constant churn.

      Reliable service isn't just about fixing things when they break.

      It's about:

      - Keeping software up to date
      - Monitoring performance
      - Reviewing security posture
      - Spotting small issues before they grow    

      Most of this work happens quietly in the background. Ideally, you won't notice it at all.

      Your website simply keeps working.

      Sometimes a business outgrows its current setup. Sometimes a plugin becomes unreliable. Sometimes a hosting configuration needs adjustment.

      When that happens, you'll get straightforward advice in plain language.

      No pressure. No scare tactics. Just a clear explanation of what's happening and what makes sense next.

      What most business owners really want is consistency.

      Someone who understands their website.

      Someone who takes responsibility.

      Someone who communicates clearly.

      Reliable service isn't flashy. It's steady.

      If you're looking for long-term website support at a fair and predictable price, get in touch and we can talk about what would suit your business.
