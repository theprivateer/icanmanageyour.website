      Websites don't stay secure by accident.

      They need ongoing attention. Updates. Patches. Small adjustments behind the scenes. Without that steady care, even a well-built site can become vulnerable over time.

      Most security problems aren't dramatic hacks carried out by a mastermind. They're automated scripts scanning for outdated software and known weaknesses.

      If your site isn't being maintained, it's only a matter of time.

    title: 'Why regular maintenance matters'
    content: |-
      Every website is built on layers:

      - The server and operating system    
      - The content management system (such as WordPress)
      - Themes and plugins
      - Third-party integrations
      - Custom code

      Each of those layers receives updates over time. Some improve performance. Some add features. Many fix security vulnerabilities.

      If those updates are ignored, risk quietly builds.

      Regular maintenance keeps your website aligned with current security standards and reduces the chance of avoidable incidents.

      One of the biggest causes of broken websites is unmanaged updates.

      Clicking "update all" in WordPress without checking compatibility can lead to layout issues, plugin conflicts, or full site errors. On the other hand, avoiding updates entirely leaves you exposed.

      The right approach sits in the middle.

      For WordPress and other CMS-based websites, I:

      - Review available updates    
      - Apply them in a controlled, sensible order
      - Check compatibility between plugins, themes, and core
      - Test key functionality after updates
      - Roll back safely if something unexpected happens

      The goal is simple: keep your site secure without introducing instability.

      Plugins and themes are often the weakest link in a CMS-based site.

      Some are actively maintained. Others are quietly abandoned. Over time, that can create:

      - Security vulnerabilities    
      - Compatibility issues
      - Performance slowdowns
      - Increasing fragility

      Part of regular maintenance involves reviewing what's installed and making sensible decisions about what stays and what goes.

      Less complexity usually means fewer problems.

    title: 'Monitoring for early warning signs'
    content: |-
      Security isn't just about reacting after something goes wrong. It's about spotting early indicators.

      That might include:

      - Suspicious login attempts    
      - File changes that shouldn't have happened
      - Unusual server behaviour
      - Performance changes that suggest deeper issues

      By monitoring your site and its environment, issues can often be addressed before they escalate.

    title: 'Fixing vulnerabilities properly'
    content: |-
      If a security issue is identified, it needs more than a surface-level fix.

      That may involve:

      - Removing compromised files    
      - Updating or replacing vulnerable components
      - Hardening configuration settings
      - Reviewing user accounts and permissions
      - Confirming clean backups are available

      It's not about panic. It's about methodical repair and strengthening the site so it's less likely to happen again.

      Most of this work is invisible.

      You won't see security patches being applied or plugin reviews being conducted. That's the point. Your website should feel stable and uneventful.

      Security maintenance is about preventing disruption, not constantly responding to it.

      If updates have been sitting untouched, or if you're unsure whether your site is properly maintained, it's worth taking a closer look.

      Regular, controlled maintenance dramatically reduces risk and keeps your website dependable.
