      Your website should be easy to update without feeling fragile or complicated.

      That's why I use [Statamic](https://statamic.com) as the content management system for many of the websites I build. It offers flexibility and power without getting in your way, and it's designed to feel calm and understandable rather than overwhelming.

      Statamic is built around a simple idea: managing content shouldn't be harder than creating it.

      Updating your website feels natural:

      - edit text directly, without fighting the layout    
      - replace images quickly and safely
      - add new pages without breaking existing ones
      - manage content in a way that mirrors how you think

      You don't need to understand code, templates, or technical structure to keep your site current.

    title: 'Fast and reliable by design'

      Statamic is known for being fast.

      Because of how it's built, pages load quickly and consistently, even as your site grows. That speed benefits both visitors and search engines, and it doesn't degrade over time as content is added.

      Reliability is just as important. Statamic avoids many of the failure points that affect heavier systems, which means fewer surprises and less ongoing maintenance friction.

      Security shouldn't require constant vigilance.

      Statamic's architecture reduces many common security risks by design, which means:

      - fewer urgent updates    
      - less exposure to automated attacks
      - a smaller maintenance burden over time

      That doesn't mean security is ignored. It means it's handled sensibly, without turning website ownership into a source of anxiety.

      Statamic works well across a wide range of projects.

      It's a good fit for:

      - brochure-style business websites
      - content-heavy sites with articles, resources, or case studies
      - product catalogues and e-commerce setups
      - sites that start simple and grow gradually

      You're not locked into a narrow use case. The system adapts as your needs change.

      Many websites start small and become more important over time.

      Statamic supports that growth without forcing a rebuild:

      - new sections can be added cleanly    
      - content models can evolve
      - performance stays solid as complexity increases

      You're not boxed into early decisions that limit you later.

    title: 'Confidence instead of hesitation'

      One of the biggest benefits clients notice is confidence.

      When a site is easy to manage, people actually use it. Content stays fresh. Small improvements happen naturally instead of being postponed "until later".

      You don't feel like every change is risky.

    title: 'You can manage it yourself, or hand it over'
    content: |-
      Some clients want full control. Others would rather not touch the website at all.

      Both are fine.

      If you want to manage updates yourself, Statamic makes that comfortable and predictable.

      If you'd prefer someone else handle updates, changes, and ongoing care, I'm happy to do that too. The system supports both approaches cleanly.

    content: |-
      If you want a website that's easy to update, fast to load, and built on a system that won't get in your way as your business evolves, Statamic is a strong foundation.

      I use it to build websites that are calm to own, simple to manage, and solid over the long term.

      If you'd like to talk about whether Statamic is the right fit for your website, or whether you'd rather have updates handled for you, get in touch. I'm happy to explain the options and help you decide what makes the most sense.
