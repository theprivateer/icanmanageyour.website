      Running a business is already a full-time job.

      The last thing most owners or managers want is to log into a hosting panel, troubleshoot a plugin conflict, or work out why a security warning has appeared overnight.

      For many of my clients, the website is important, but it's not their area of expertise. And it doesn't need to be.

      My role is to take that weight off your shoulders.

      Hosting, updates, SSL certificates, backups, performance tweaks, security patches… these things matter. But you shouldn't have to think about them.

      If your website is critical to your enquiries, bookings, sales, or reputation, it needs to be:

      - Online and accessible    
      - Secure and up to date
      - Fast and reliable
      - Quietly maintained in the background

      You don't need a crash course in how it all works. You need confidence that it's handled.

      I typically work with:

      ### Small business owners with limited time

      You might be wearing five different hats already. Marketing, operations, sales, admin. The website often becomes "something I'll deal with later" until something goes wrong.

      I make sure it doesn't get to that point.

      ### Teams without in-house technical staff

      Many growing businesses have great people in marketing, admin, or operations, but no dedicated web or technical resource. When something breaks, it becomes a scramble.

      Instead of bouncing between freelancers or generic support desks, you have one consistent point of contact.

      ### Businesses that rely on their website but don't want to manage it

      If your website drives leads, processes bookings, or supports customers, it's too important to ignore. But that doesn't mean you want to be hands-on with it.

      You can focus on running your business. I'll focus on keeping your site healthy.

      ### Organisations that need a dependable partner

      Sometimes what you really need is someone who understands your website and your business context. Someone who can give clear advice, not just technical answers.

      That's the difference between "support" and a working relationship.

      When you work with me, you're not submitting tickets into a queue.

      You're dealing with one person who:

      - Knows how your website is built    
      - Understands your hosting setup
      - Has visibility of past changes and issues
      - Can explain things in plain language

      There's no repeating your story every time something comes up. No being passed between departments.

      Just clear communication and steady support.

      Good website management isn't about reacting when something breaks. It's about preventing problems in the first place.

      It's about knowing that:

      - Updates are being applied safely    
      - Backups are in place and tested
      - Security risks are monitored
      - Performance isn't slowly degrading
      - Small issues are caught early

      Most of the work is invisible. That's exactly how it should be.
